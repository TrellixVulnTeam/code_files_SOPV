Chapter 3: Linux Command-Line for Beginners: What's happening on this 
machine?

-------- Notes on symbols and codes: ----------

-------- Basic Codes: --------------------------

w provides information on users, uptime, local or external user
   every terminal that is opened is also shown
   TTY = Terminal, FROM = where (0 = local), LOGIN@ = login time
   IDLE = Idle Time, ... WHAT = what process is being run by that 
user/terminal

who short information on users and log in time

top process manager/ task manager (shows top programs requiring CPU 
power)
   PID (number) is used to stop a specific process

netstat -tupln shows information about local addresses and programs that 
are being run from those locations
                   DON'T USE netstat without any flags, as it will give 
you a huge amount of information.

----------- Software packages: ---------------------- If you run into 
problems with software (while following the tutorial), use the following 
command:

 sudo apt-get install

followed by these packages:

htop net-tools



Chapter 4: Linux Sysadmin Basics 03 -- Text Editors (and review of basic 
commands)



------- General notes: ----------------------





-------- Notes on symbols and codes: ----------

.  current directory

..  directory above

../..  directory above the directory



ls flags

-a all (hidden + all directories)

-l long (full information on file (or all files)

-h human (making it easy to read)

-alh all 3 flags combined



-------- Basic Codes: --------------------------

mkdir Makes a new directory (folder)

   Flagging with "-p" allows entire filepaths to be made



rm Remove

   Flagging with "-r" (recursive) removes everything in that directory



cp Copy (e.g. cp location/file.txt newlocation/newfilename.txt)

   When wanting a copy in the same file location, use "." as the file 
location



mv Move/Rename (to rename simply don't provide the directory)



cat Read file. Multiple files can be read after each other by adding 
them to the cat command with spaces



nano texteditor (with GNU) recommended to use for now.



vi texteditor (with GNU) recommended to read the manual for this.

      :q! = quit w = write



----------- Software packages: ----------------------

If you want to check out the other texteditors:



sudo apt install vim

sudo apt install emacs-25

Linux Sysadmin Basics 04 -- Shell Features -- Pipes and Redirection 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

pipes ||

There are three kind of file descriptions

echo "STDIN ---> 0"
echo "STDOUT ---> 1"
echo "STDERR ---> 2"

ex$ echo "This should be in some file" 1>somefile.txt
>	Overwrite output in file
>>	Append output in file

<	Input funnel

PIPE
ps aux		All the processes
ps aux |less	more readable

prog && prog2	if prog1 runs then prog2 also runs

cat file.txt | cut -d: -f2
grep someone ./*

Linux Sysadmin Basics 06 -- Process Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------
What is a process?
PROCESSES :
basically a program that runs

link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/

"has 2 parts" :
1. adress space that it can use, where it can write to
2. kernel data structure keeping following information :

* PID : primary key for processes
* parent id : pid of process that started this one, if parent dies then child process is reparented to "init" process
* UID : tells which user owns the process (same for groupID)
* EffectiveUserID : (EUID) process spawned by user but shouldn't have same permissions as user (same for EgroupID)
* Niceness : if NI high then it's low priority and let's lower NI processes take resources

Life cycle of a process :
created by parent process by forking itself,
giving child that starts other programs/processes
death : exiting with return value given to parent process

case of init: (for ubuntu)
started at kernel boot, runs all startup scripts

VIM set python indentation
set expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4

Common Network Commands
-------------------------------------------------
1. ifconfig

2. iwconfig

3. ping

4. arp -a

5. netstat -ano
