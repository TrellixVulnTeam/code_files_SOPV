\section{Definition}
\label{sec:orgd9d4402}

\subsection{Solution Summary}
\label{sec:org7954250}

You cannot push to the one checked out branch of a repository because it would mess with the user of that repository in a way that will most probably end with \textbf{\textbf{loss of data and history}}. But you can push to any other branch of the same repository.

As bare repositories never have any branch checked out, you can always push to any branch of a bare repository.

\textbf{\textbf{There are multiple solutions, depending on your needs.}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Solution 1: Use a Bare Repostiory
\end{itemize}

As suggested, if on one machine, you don't need the working directory, you can move to a bare repository. To avoid messing with the repository, you can just clone it:

\begin{verbatim}
machine1$ cd ..
machine1$ mv repo repo.old
machine1$ git clone --bare repo.old repo

\end{verbatim}
Now you can push all you want to the same address as before.

\begin{itemize}
\item Solution 2: Push to a Non-Checked-Out Branch
\end{itemize}

But if you need to check out the code on your remote `<remote>`, then you can use a special branch to push. Let's say that in your local repository you have called your remote `origin` and you're on branch master. Then you could do

\textasciitilde{}    machine2\$ git push origin master:master+machine2\textasciitilde{}

Then you need to merge it when you're in the `origin` remote repo:

\textasciitilde{}    machine1\$ git merge master+machine2\textasciitilde{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Autopsy of the Problem
\end{itemize}

When a branch is checked out, committing will add a new commit with the current branch's head as its parent and move the branch's head to be that new commit.

So

A ¡ö B
    ¡ô
[HEAD,branch1]

becomes

A ¡ö B ¡ö C
	¡ô
    [HEAD,branch1]

But if someone could push to that branch inbetween, the user would get itself in what git calls \textbf{\textbf{detached head}} mode:

A ¡ö B ¡ö X
    ¡ô   ¡ô
[HEAD] [branch1]

Now the user is not in branch1 anymore, without having explicitly asked to check out another branch. Worse, the user is now \textbf{\textbf{outside any branch}}, and any new commit will just be \textbf{\textbf{dangling}}:

      [HEAD]
	¡õ
	C
      ¡ú
A ¡ö B ¡ö X
	¡ô
       [branch1]

Hypothetically, if at this point, the user checks out another branch, then this dangling commit becomes fair game for Git's \textbf{\textbf{garbage collector}}.
